.c files of tuls.c and tucp.c that compile commonly used commands ls and cp.

PART A:

tuls.c: Using C Library functions scandir(), opendir(), and readdir(), tuls takes 1 or 0 arguements. When given 0, it lists all of the current directory's files. When given 1 arguement, which is the directory's path, it identifies entries inside the given directory as a folder or another directory, which then recursively prints out those directory's files.

tucp.c: PART B
